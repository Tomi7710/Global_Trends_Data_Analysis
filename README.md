#### Trends and Performance Insights

For this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on Olympic games data to examine trends in athlete performance, medal distribution and the evolution of participation patterns across countries and genders.

The libraries used for this analysis include Pandas, seaborn and Matplotlib.




#### Result: The relationship between athletes and medals

We observe that the data points are clustered closely in the lower left corner meaning most countries send fewer athletes to events and win fewer medals. The above findings suggest that when the number of athletes increases, the number of medals increases for each country. Therefore, an increase in the number of athletes will lead to an increase in the number of medals for various events in each country.
