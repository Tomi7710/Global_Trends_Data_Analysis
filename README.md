### Trends and Performance Insights

For this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on Olympic games data to examine trends in athlete performance, medal distribution and the evolution of participation patterns across countries and genders.

#### Tools & Libraries
- Python
  - Pandas - data cleaning, transformation and aggregation
  - Seaborn and Matplotlib - data visualization

#### Insights
- Participation size strongly correlates with medal success.  
- Historical trends reveal how national investment impacts performance.  
- Data visualization highlights major shifts across time.


#### Sample Result: The relationship between athletes and medals

#### Insights
The analysis shows a clear link between participation and performance across countries.
- Most countries send few athletes and win few medals.
- A positive correlation exists between team size and medal count â€” larger teams tend to win more medals.
- Broader participation appears to enhance overall performance at global events.
